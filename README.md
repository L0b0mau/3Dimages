# 3Dimages
This is a small Python script to render your images into 3D plots

you can either show it as 3D scatterplot and manipulate it with your mouse, or if your PC is as slow as mine, just let the function run and render/save the various perspectives for you.

The image can be of jpg, png, gif and maybe other formats.
Remember that the image should be small if you want decent processing times. This script does not render via the GPU or even more than one core, which makes it suuuper slow^^
15 images of a 150x150 pixel png input, took me 113 seconds,the 512x512 lenna gif took already 1050 seconds(17,5 mins)!
So you can image how it scales up^^

It is a very short and simple script but I had some fun with it.
There is huge space for improvement, so do not hesitate pushing new code into this repository ;)
